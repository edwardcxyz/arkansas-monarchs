# Landowner Resources

Eighty percent of the land in Arkansas is privately owned, and the land 
management decisions of landowners impact pollinators. Arkansas’s private 
landowners and agricultural producers can create and enhance high-quality 
habitat on their property. Federal and state cost-share programs are 
available to provide financial assistance for some practices.

Staff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Arkansas Game 
and Fish Commission (AGFC), Quail Forever, and Partners for Fish and Wildlife 
(USFWS) work with landowners to develop conservation plans specific to the 
landowners’ objectives and provide free technical assistance. Each plan 
focuses on monarch and pollinator habitat management and is tailored to the 
property. These plans provide a roadmap for how to use a system of 
conservation practices to meet natural resource and production goals.

Your local biologist can also provide a 100% native seed mix that is 
appropriate for where you are located in the state and a list of native 
seed vendors that you can contact for price quotes. Please contact your 
local biologist before you order seed for your project so they can help 
you ensure that all of the species in the mix are native to Arkansas.
