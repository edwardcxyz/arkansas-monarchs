# Landowner Resources

Eighty percent of the land in Arkansas is privately owned, and the land 
management decisions of landowners impact pollinators. Arkansas’s private 
landowners and agricultural producers can create and enhance high-quality 
habitat on their property. Federal and state cost-share programs are 
available to provide financial assistance for some practices.

Staff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Arkansas Game 
and Fish Commission (AGFC), Quail Forever, and Partners for Fish and Wildlife 
(USFWS) work with landowners to develop conservation plans specific to the 
landowners’ objectives and provide free technical assistance. Each plan 
focuses on monarch and pollinator habitat management and is tailored to the 
property. These plans provide a roadmap for how to use a system of 
conservation practices to meet natural resource and production goals.

Your local biologist can also provide a 100% native seed mix that is 
appropriate for where you are located in the state and a list of native 
seed vendors that you can contact for price quotes. Please contact your 
local biologist before you order seed for your project so they can help 
you ensure that all of the species in the mix are native to Arkansas.

::: tip Landowners who are interested in establishing monarch and pollinator habitat, native grazing, forest management, or learning about what they can do on their property to create habitat should reach out to one of the agencies or organizations below for free technical assistance.

# [Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/ar/contact/local/)
Contact your local NRCS field office for free technical assistance and to learn 
what federal Farm Bill programs you may be eligible for to implement beneficial 
practices for monarchs, pollinators, and other wildlife.

# [Quail Forever](https://www.quailforever.org/Habitat/findBiologist.aspx)
In partnership with NRCS and AGFC, Quail Forever employs field biologists 
(Farm Bill Biologists) throughout the state to provide free technical 
assistance. Their field biologist program is designed to assist farmers, 
landowners and the general public about the economic benefits of conservation 
programs, as well as delivering habitat programs that benefit pollinators and 
other wildlife. They call it the "One Stop Shop" for anything conservation and 
wildlife related on private and public lands.

# [Arkansas Game and Fish Commission](https://www.agfc.com/en/wildlife-management/private-lands-program/private-lands-biologist/)
Arkansas Game and Fish Commission has Private Lands Biologists that provide 
free technical assistance to landowners and houses the Acres for Wildlife 
(AFW) program. Acres for Wildlife is a free environmental action program of 
the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission which targets all wildlife species 
and gives special emphasis on species of greatest conservation concern. It 
improves habitat and encourages landowners to consider wildlife in conjunction 
with good farming, livestock production, and forestry practices. The program 
does not retire cropland or grazing land, nor does it open “posted” land to 
hunters. This is left entirely to the discretion of the owner.

# [Arkansas Department of Agriculture - Forestry Division](https://www.agriculture.arkansas.gov/forestry/)
In Arkansas, 56% of the state is forested, and 67% of that is non-industrial 
private landowners. As such, the Arkansas Department of Agriculture - Forestry 
Division offers landowners a variety of technical assistance in forest 
management, free of charge upon request. County Foresters are trained to work 
with partners to better assist landowners toward their management goals. County 
Foresters can provide information on practices with the purpose of restoring 
or enhancing forested ecosystems that may include: planting, forest stand 
improvement, prescribed burning, and best management practices for water 
quality. Many of these practices that improve forest health also inherently 
improve pollinator habitat.

# [Partners for Fish and Wildlife](https://www.fws.gov/arkansas-es/staff.html)
The Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program provides technical and financial 
assistance to private landowners interested in restoring and enhancing 
wildlife habitat on their land.  Emphasis goes to projects with the potential 
to provide habitat for rare, threatened and endangered species; migratory birds 
and fish; and at-risk species.  Projects are custom-designed and tailored to 
meet landowners’ needs and objectives.
