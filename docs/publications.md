# Scholarly Publications

Since 1948 there have been approximately 1,152 scholarly publications that include Monarch Butterfly (including plural and scientific alternate versions of text) as part of the title, abstract, or as keyword in citation index searches. Publication data were reviewed for duplication, applicability, and reviewed for errors within Zotero reference management software prior to being summarized. The number of publications has been steadily increasing since this time as shown in the below chart. Publications between January 2014 and March 2018 account for 25% of the total publications recovered through citation index search. This increase may be as a result of increased awareness, or funding opportunities made available after the announcement of the Presidential Memorandum in 2014; or perhaps the growing number of publications have influenced policy to informed action resulting in the issuance in the Presidential Memorandum. Data for these analyses were collected in March 2018.
